            <h2>Why Munich?</h2>
            <h3>Munich hosts the largest folk festival in the world!</h3>
            <p>
              Every September, Munich hosts the largest folk festival in the
              world. The city has several of the largest breweries in Germany
              and is famous for its beer and its annual Oktoberfest celebration.
              Here's how the tradition got started. Every year, millions of
              revelers descend on a tent-filled meadow in Munich to celebrate
              the love of long-ago Bavarian royals at a celebration known as
              Oktoberfest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Munich, on the other hand, is not only wealthier but far better
              preserved. People from all over the world are drawn there for its
              economy, castles, and bustling street life. Munich is a major
              tourist destination and a convention centre. Book publishing and
              printing and television production are also important.

                <h4>Ballabeni Icecream</h4>
                <p>
                  This icecream shop is suggested for the good combination of
                  tastes like basilico-lemon and other unusual ones. The quality
                  of the ice cream is good and this is why normally you need to
                  queue in front of it

                <p>
                  Excellent icecream, interesting but delicious flavours. They
                  also give you an additional spoon of one flavour you would
                  like to try. When we were there all flavours were gluten free
                  so that was a plus also.

                  Creative and new ice cream flavors that you can hardly find
                  anywhere else. Plus it's extra tasty and with friendly
                  service. The tasting spoon makes you want more!

                <p>
                  I like going there because there are always crazy new
                  varieties that you can try. You always get a spoon to try. The
                  waitresses are very nice and the prices are very good in
                  relation to the quality.

                  A vegan ice cream shop! Good choices of flavours and generous portions. 
                  Ice without added sugar that tastes. It tastes different than
                  normal ice, don't expect the taste of normal non-vegan ice.

                  A must-go for ice cream lovers who want to enjoy healthy and
                  delicious ice cream. The texture is probably a bit more dense
                  than regular dairy ice cream, and two balls are certainly
                  enough (for me at least!!).
