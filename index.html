            <h2>Why Munich?</h2>
            <h3>Munich hosts the largest folk festival in the world!</h3>
            <p>
              Every September, Munich hosts the largest folk festival in the
              world. The city has several of the largest breweries in Germany
              and is famous for its beer and its annual Oktoberfest celebration.
              Here's how the tradition got started. Every year, millions of
              revelers descend on a tent-filled meadow in Munich to celebrate
              the love of long-ago Bavarian royals at a celebration known as
              Oktoberfest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Munich, on the other hand, is not only wealthier but far better
              preserved. People from all over the world are drawn there for its
              economy, castles, and bustling street life. Munich is a major
              tourist destination and a convention centre. Book publishing and
              printing and television production are also important.

              Hi! My name is Anaisa and I'm doing this project about Munich due
              to wanting to move there very soon for my professional career. I

              Add-on to further develop my coding skills.
